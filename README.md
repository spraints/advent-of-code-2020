# Matt's Advent of Code 2020

I decided to do React + Typescript + Rust this year. There's a UI for the different puzzles in the `web` dir and the solutions are in the `api_server` dir.

To use this, run: `docker-compose up` and then browse to http://127.0.0.1:3000/.

I used https://github.com/ghotiphud/rust-web-starter as a template.
